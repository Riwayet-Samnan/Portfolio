My personal website

### Parcel-bundler was used during site development
install [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org)
```
npm i -g parcel-bundler
```

### This also uses the [GSAP](https://greensock.com) package
```
npm i -d gsap
```

The main code and images that are used during development are in the ```src``` folder
And the parcel-built minified code is the ```dist``` folder
